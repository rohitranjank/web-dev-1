                <h3>Could dark energy be changing over time?</h3>
                <p>Dark energy has been a profound puzzle since its discovery 25 years ago. Cosmologists had known since the 1920s that the universe was expanding, and models predicted that the gravitational pull of matter would slow this expansion over time. But in the late 1990s, two separate teams of astronomers noticed that bright supernovae in the distant universe were dimmer than expected . This implied that some unknown effect was acting in opposition to gravity, causing the expansion of space to accelerate. This unknown thing was named “dark energy.” Theorists are still at a loss to explain what it is. That's a pretty big gap in our knowledge, given that the stuff makes up most of the total energy of the universe</p>

                <h3>Artificial Intelligence: Shaping the Future</h3>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, learn, and make decisions. From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to advanced self-driving cars, AI is rapidly becoming a part of our everyday lives.One of AI's key strengths is its ability to analyze vast amounts of data and identify patterns faster than humans. This makes it useful in fields like healthcare (for diagnosing diseases), finance (for detecting fraud), and education (for personalized learning).However, AI also raises important challenges. Concerns about job displacement, privacy, and ethical decision-making are growing as AI becomes more powerful. Striking the right balance between innovation and responsibility is crucial.In the future, AI is expected to transform industries even further, making processes more efficient and creating new opportunities. If used wisely, it has the potential to improve lives, solve global challenges, and shape a smarter, more connected world.</p>

                <h3>Information Technology: The Backbone of the Digital Age</h3>
                <p>Information Technology (IT) is the use of computers, networks, and digital systems to store, process, and share information. It has become the backbone of modern society, powering everything from business operations to social communication.In today's world, IT is everywhere—online banking, cloud storage, e-commerce, mobile apps, and even smart homes all rely on it. Businesses use IT to improve efficiency, governments use it to deliver services, and individuals use it for learning, entertainment, and staying connected.The IT sector also drives innovation through areas like cybersecurity, cloud computing, big data, and artificial intelligence. With the rise of remote work and global connectivity, IT plays a key role in shaping how we live and work.As technology continues to advance, IT will remain at the heart of progress, creating opportunities and solutions for a digital future.</p>
